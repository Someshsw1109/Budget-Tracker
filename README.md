# Budget-Tracker-Application

**This Java project is a simple Budget Tracker application. It allows a user to track their income and expenses and view their current balance. Here's a brief explanation:**

*Balance Management: The application maintains a balance, which starts at 0.0. The user can add income to increase the balance or add expenses to decrease it.*

*User Interaction: The application uses a menu-based system to interact with the user. The user can:*

  *1-Add income by entering the amount they earned.*
  *2-Add expenses by entering the amount they spent.*
  *3-View the current balance to see how much money they have left.*
**Continuous Operation: The program runs in a loop, repeatedly offering the menu options until the user chooses to exit by selecting the "Exit" option.**

**Simple Input/Output: The application uses a Scanner for input and basic System.out.println statements to display information and prompt the user.**

**This project is an example of basic user input handling, simple arithmetic operations for balance management, and loop control in Java.**
